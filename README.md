# Diamond Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting diamond prices based on their physical and categorical attributes. The project utilizes the **Diamonds Dataset** from Kaggle and demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment process.

---

## **Project Overview**

Diamonds are evaluated based on their **carat**, **cut**, **color**, **clarity**, and other physical dimensions. This project develops a regression model to predict diamond prices with high accuracy. Key features of this project include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering (e.g., symmetry calculation, one-hot encoding)
- Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Cross-Validation for Robust Evaluation
- Model Deployment Using Flask or FastAPI
- Interactive Visualizations with Bokeh

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `bokeh`, `plotly`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`
- **Deployment:** Flask/FastAPI for real-time prediction

---

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Feature transformations (e.g., symmetry ratio)
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Heatmaps and pairplots to explore feature relationships
   - Histograms for price distribution

3. **Model Training**
   - Models used:
     - Linear Regression
     - Lasso Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Random Forest
   - Cross-validation for model performance evaluation
   - Hyperparameter optimization using `GridSearchCV`

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics:
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     - RÂ² Score
   - Feature Importance Analysis with `ExtraTreesRegressor`

5. **Deployment**
   - Flask or FastAPI app for real-time predictions
   - Input diamond features (e.g., carat, cut, color, clarity) via API or web interface

6. **Interactive Visualizations**
   - Explore relationships like price vs. carat or price vs. clarity dynamically using Bokeh/Plotly.
